  <!-- Trapped -->
  <h1>Trapped</h1>
  <h3>-by Gourav</h3>
  <pre>
Purposes, purposes  
Don’t forget me,  
I create my purposes  
From the empty life of me.  

No one got their purposes  
At the time they were born.  
Some die, still questioning,  
Some finds, changes the world.  

Am I The Best?  
Narcissism asked.  
Truth knocks door,  
The Lad ignored.  

Delusion trapped him,  
He died in silence.  
No traces left,  
Nor greatness.  

Freedom is peace,  
Many think.  
Freedom is choices,  
Hard to make.  

Freedom is loneliness  
You cannot take.  

Knowledge scares me,  
Constant comparison.  
I die from inside—  
This quiet competition.  

Everything compared  
By this world.  
None knew knowledge,  
But spitted it all.  

Myself asks me,  
"Why am I loser?"  
Narcissism replies,  
"I’m The Best loser."  

Nihilism says,  
"Is it all real?"  
Myself tired of  
Constant comparison.  

"Fake everyone"  
Nihilist said.  
Soft me thinks  
The statement’s fake.  

Everyone left me,  
I’m so alone.  
Myself beside me,  
Personality of all.  

Life is consequences,  
One wrong move.  
Knowledge is curse—  
How to prove?  

I chose wrong path,  
"Correcting myself,"  
That pothole  
Which Killed myself.  

Myself asks quietly,  
"Am I broken? Am I ill?"  
Thoughts too loud,  
Mind never still.  

Words died.  
Can’t confess.  
Nothing to say much.  
Hurted myself.

    <h2>Hidden Meaning</h2>
    <p>
      This poem is not just about life or sadness. It's about the quiet destruction caused by constant comparison, by the pressure to be "the best," by a system that demands purpose when purpose doesn't naturally exist.<br><br>
      The voices in the poem—narcissism, nihilism, self-doubt—are all parts of the poet himself, fighting for control in an overthinking mind that refuses to rest. The poet questions if knowledge itself is a curse; the more he learns, the heavier life becomes, the more trapped he feels.<br><br>
      It's also a message to the world: The system tried to break a mind like his. It wanted him to fit in, to compete, to suffer quietly. But instead, he wrote this. And by writing, he survived. His thoughts are now immortal, living in this poem, on this page.<br><br>
      The poem ends not with an answer, but with exhausted silence. Like Schrödinger’s cat—he is both broken and whole, dead and alive, trapped and free. And that, too, is his truth.

  <!-- False Truth -->
  <h1>False Truth</h1>
  <h3>-by Gourav</h3>
  <pre>
Life is a myth, seen by eyes  
The false that you saw  
Shaped by dice.  
You can't hear some thoughts  
Flying in the wind.  
Evolution shaped you,  
Limited to life.  

Mind is freedom, thoughts are yours,  
Revolution thoughts, which changed the world.  

Mind is blunt, limited life.  
Choices in your hands,  
Be remembered, or just dies.

    <h2>Hidden Meaning</h2>
    <p>
      Life is just a myth. Some animals can hear and see things humans can't. The “flying thoughts” represent sounds or ideas outside the range of human perception. Humans, though limited biologically, have the mind — and with it, the freedom to imagine, rebel, and create.<br><br>
      But society and its system blur that freedom. They force conformity and silence the revolutionary thoughts that could change the world. The final lines are a challenge: either rise and break the cycle, or vanish without leaving a mark.<br><br>
      It’s a call to wake up, to use the mind not just to survive — but to be remembered.
